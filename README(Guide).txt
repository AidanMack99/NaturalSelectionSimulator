I've included multiple versions for submission, The product was made in unity and i believe the best way to visually see the product working is within the unity editor, therefore i've included the project folder from unity,
which you should be able to just import directly into unity. 

If unity is available to use i would suggest using it, however i've had issues with it importing weirdly on different devices. So i've included an executable which will run the program all the same, except within unity you can 
click on any creature to see its exact energy/speed in realtime instead of just a visual change in colour, all speeds and energys are exported to a chosen excel file regardless.

When the program is loaded a button for a guide is present which will explain the logic and functionality behind the product

Right before submission i've realized Unity doens't allow selecting files in runtime, so i can no longer have a pop up window to select a blank excel file to write the results to, i originally had a hard coded filepath for testing.
If the product works in the unity editor, just open the CreatureScript and change the "filepath" string to where a blank excel file you have created is.

If only running the executable is available i was not able to work around this. I've included an excel file with written results on it, to show how it would normally be written, and included 3 graphs to show how the data would 
be visualised. I intended to have a script to visualise the data in realtime but couldn't get it working in time


Source code for all scripts is located in ToyPlanetv1(unityproject folder)/Assests/Scripts     (Main Script is CreatureScript)
